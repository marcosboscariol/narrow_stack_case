At NarrowStack, our client, we work a lot with files, mainly Excel and CSV.
I would like you to build a docker compose file/dockerfile with the service MageAI. 
This container will be reproduced in another machine, so be sure it works properly.
In MageAI, write one pipeline that opens the four files in this folder and save them as parquet files.
Everything you do beyond this will be considered as a plus (e.g. save in another service like MinIO, set up a data transformation tool, etc).

You can use LLMs to help you.
You have two days to do this and send me the results (you can send me before this time).
